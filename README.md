# TaskMetrics
TaskMetrics is a Desktop agent tool that keeps track of user activity and project progress.

## Branch naming
The recommended branch naming convention will be:
> TM\<Type>-<Ticket-Number>

For example, if Ticket #31 is a **_Task_**, then:
> TMT-31

If Ticket #32 is a **_Bug_**, then:
> TMB-32
